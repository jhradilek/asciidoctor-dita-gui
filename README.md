# asciidoctor-dita-gui

**asciidoctor-dita-gui** is a prototype of a simple GUI for converting
AsciiDoc files to DITA concepts, references, or tasks.

## Prerequisites

**asciidoctor-dita-gui** is written in Bash. It requires Zenity and basic GNU utilities such as `grep` and `sed` to be present in the system.

## Installation

1. Install the `asciidoctor` and `asciidoctor-dita-topic` Ruby gems:
   
   ```
   gem install asciidoctor asciidoctor-dita-topic
   ```
2. Install the `dita-convert` Python package:
   
   ```
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade dita-convert
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory with the copy of this repository and run the installation script:

   ```
   sudo make install
   ```
   You can specify the installation path by defining the `prefix` on the command line. For example, to install the script locally to the users home directory, type:

   ```
   make prefix=$HOME/.local install
   ```

## Usage

Run the `asciidoctor-dita-gui` script as follows:

```
asciidoctor-dita-gui [ASCIIDOC_FILE]
```
The `ASCIIDOC_FILE` argument is optional. When you do not supply a file to convert on the command line, the scripts opens a file dialog window for you to select one.

You can also create a desktop launcher for the script. On most modern systems, this will allow you to drag and drop files on the launcher to initiate the conversion:
